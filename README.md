_Lexical Analyzer

The Lexical Analyzer is responsible for separating the source code into lexemes, which are the words that compose the code. 
After separating all lexemes, the LA classifies them using Token classification. 
Keywords, Special Symbols, Identifiers and Operators, are examples of tokens. 
Removing white spaces and comments from the compiled code is also a role played by the Lexical Analyzer.
The output of this process is a table containing the lexemes and their token classification.
This project is an implementation of a simple Lexical Analyzer made in Java.

_Recogized Tokens

The Lexical Analyzer of this project recognizes the following classes of tokens:

-Identifier
-String Literal
-Int Literal
-Real Literal
-Key words {"boolean", "break", "continue", "else", "for", "float", "if", "int", "return", "void", "while"}
-Operator
-Separator
-Invalid 

_How to

Useage is simple.
1. Run the Analyzer
2. Copy the path of the input 
3. Input the path (Copy Absolute path and no '"')
4. Your output will be in the Download folder.
